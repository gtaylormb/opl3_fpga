    lwip_udp_perf_server:
      description: The LwIP UDP Perf Server application is used for creating UDP server and measure downlink performance using light-weight IP stack (lwIP). This application sets up the board to use default IP address 192.168.1.10, with MAC address 00:0a:35:00:01:02. The application creates UDP server on board and starts listening for UDP client connections. It will display client connection information with interim and average UDP statistics for data transfer.

    lwip_udp_perf_client:
      description: The LwIP UDP Perf Client application is used for creating UDP client and measure UDP uplink performance using light-weight IP stack (lwIP). This application sets up the board to use default IP address 192.168.1.10, with MAC address 00:0a:35:00:01:02. This application creates UDP client on board and make connection with UDP server running on host machine. It will display connection information along with interim and average UDP statistics for data transfer.

      description: First Stage Bootloader (FSBL) for Zynq. The FSBL configures the FPGA with HW bit stream (if it exists) and loads the Operating System (OS) Image or Standalone (SA) Image or 2nd Stage Boot Loader image from the non-volatile memory (NAND/NOR/QSPI) to RAM (DDR) and starts executing it.  It supports multiple partitions, and each partition can be a code image or a bit stream.
