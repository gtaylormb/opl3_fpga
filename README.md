## News
2024-4-27
* OPL3_FPGA has been merged into https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/ao486_MiSTer and replaced the old Z80-based OPL3 core!

2024-4-10
* Massive refactoring. I changed up the top level interface/bus protocol to better match the real chip and make it easier to integrate into other projects. The register map is now internal instead of an external AXI version. Clock domain
crossing logic is included to go between CPU and OPL3. This along with significant internal logic reduction work has massively cut down the area. LUT utilization was reduced by 78%, registers by 89%.
The Zybo design also now requires Vivado/Vitis 2023.2 (though the SystemVerilog syntax has been slightly dumbed down to support Quartus 17 for easier integration with other certain projects). 2023.2 is a lot more version control friendly and the repo is a lot cleaner now. There's also some bug fixes regarding rhythm and timers/irq are now properly implemented (but still optional).

2019-11-7
* The OPL2 subset of OPL3_FPGA was converted to Verilog by Magnus Karlsson, and then ported to the Panologic thin client (a Spartan-3E based board) by Skip Hansen. The project can be found here: https://github.com/skiphansen/panog1_opl3

2018-1-7
* The FPGA and imfplay software build flows have been tested on Vivado 2017.4. No changes are necessary.
* Walter van Niftrik's work on the ScummVM/DOSBox projects and PetaLinux daemon <a href="https://github.com/waltervn/opl3_fpga-apps">allowing the OPL3-FPGA to be used as a realtime output device</a> for both emulators is really cool. I've updated everything for Vivado/PetaLinux 2017.4, and I'll be updating my fork soon. I'll also include prebuilt binary SD card images for people to easily take advantage of it without having to setup a build environment, and a YouTube demo so you can see how cool it is.

2016-6-11
* FPGA and software build flows have been updated for Vivado 2016.1.
* I have been working with one of the ScummVM devs, Walter van Niftrik, to use the OPL3_FPGA as an OPL3 output device in ScummVM and DOSBox over USB. His code is over at https://github.com/waltervn/opl3_fpga-apps and https://github.com/waltervn/dosbox. He has a daemon running on top of PetaLinux instead of bare metal on the ARM. This is very cool and something I always envisioned.

Every effort possible has been made to replicate, bit-true, the math of the original OPL3 chip. Several other very smart people put in a lot of work before me to get as close as possible to this goal in software, and this FPGA design would not be possible without their work. Their efforts included <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18IGx18NQY_Q1PJVZ-bHywao9bhsDoAqoIn1rIm42nwo/edit">de-lidding the chip to extract the actual values out of the ROMs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gtaylormb/opl3_fpga/blob/master/docs/opl3math/opl3math.pdf">in-dept analysis of the math involved</a>. They're all over at http://forums.submarine.org.uk/phpBB/viewforum.php?f=9. You can follow the progression of some of the reverse engineering--it's quite interesting.

There are some differences between this version and the original chip in the external interface due to the hardware on
the board that I'm using. The design is targeted to the <a href="https://www.digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?Prod=ZYBO">Digilent ZYBO board</a>
which has the <a href="http://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/soc/zynq-7000.html">Xilinx Zynq-7000
SoC</a> containing an ARM dual-core Cortex-A9 and an FPGA. The board also has an
<a href="http://www.analog.com/en/products/audio-video/audio-codecs/ssm2603.html#product-overview">Analog Devices SSM2603
audio codec</a> with dual 24-bit DACs. The interface to the CPU is AXI4-Lite
and the interface to the DAC is I<sup>2</sup>S, matching the particular hardware I have to work with. These
interfaces are wrapped in the design and would be easy to swap out.

The original OPL3 chip used a 14.31818MHz master clock. The sample rate was 14.31818MHz/288 = 49.7159KHz, which is quite an interesting sample rate. With 36 operator slots, that gives 8 clocks to update each operator each sample (operator logic is
time-shared between slots).

The SSM2603 on the ZYBO uses 256x oversampling, and thus requires a master clock 256x the sample clock.
I decided to use a single clock domain and keep the sample clock as close as possible to the original
chip. The ZYBO provides the FPGA with an external clock of 125MHz. Using a mixed-mode clock manager (MMCM) in the FPGA,
I'm able to synthesize a 12.727MHz clock from that, which divided by 256 gets me very close to the original
sample rate at 49.7148KHz. Updating 36 operator slots using my slower master clock only gives me 7 clock
cycles per sample instead of 8, but that's okay because I can stack tons of combinational logic up with
few pipeline registers with this slow clock speed and modern FPGA. The build meets timing with 53.1ns of slack (＠_＠;)

As far as software, so far I've ported over <a href="http://software.kvee.cz/imfplay/">imfplay</a> from x86 DOS to the ARM running bare metal. It can playback .dro files captured in DOSBox while playing the original games. They are essentially OPL3 register writes using a 1000Hz timer tick (I used the built in timer in the ARM). The files are stored in an in-memory filesystem. The whole package including the FPGA bitstream, front stage boot loader, imfplay executable, and filesystem image can be built using one command and placed on an SD card.

In doing the project, I was very impressed with what the original chip designers were able to accomplish. They used some very clever techniques to squeeze maximum functionality out of very limited resources--particularly using the combination of an exponential lookup table and a log-sine lookup table to <a href="https://github.com/gtaylormb/opl3_fpga/blob/master/docs/opl3math/opl3math.pdf">apply gain to the sine wave without the use of multipliers</a>, and the clever use of time sharing the operator resources among 36 slots.

Tools used were Modelsim, Vivado 2016.1, Octave (for sample analysis), and SVEditor (for SystemVerilog file editing).

## Digital waveform images
These were produced by writing the actual binary output values of the operator logic in simulation to a file and plotting them using Octave.

The 6 basic unmodulated waveform outputs:

## Serial command line interface

I've added a simple command line interface for playing songs.
Set your terminal to 115200 baud, 8-N-1.

    Welcome to the OPL3 FPGA

    DRO 2.0 file

## Build/run instructions (Linux)
1. If you want to add any .dro files, you may place them in software/opl3dro.
They will be included in the in-memory filesystem for playback.

2. Source the Vivado and SDK settings so all the build tools are in your path.
Example:

        source /opt/Xilinx/Vivado/2023.2/settings64.sh

3. Run 'make' to build the FPGA and software necessary to run the OPL3
and create an SD card image.

4. Copy the resulting BOOT.bin to an SD card, insert it into the ZYBO.

5. Set JP5 to SD.

6. Connect a USB cable to PROG/UART on the ZYBO. Power on the ZYBO. Your PC should detect the USB serial port device.

7. Run a terminal program, use 115200 baud, 8-N-1.

8. Reset the ZYBO by pressing PS-SRST. In your terminal you should see:
