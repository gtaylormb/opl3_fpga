#   FILENAME: Makefile
#   AUTHOR: Greg Taylor      CREATION DATE: 8 Aug 2015
#
#   DESCRIPTION:
#	1. Source the Vivado and SDK settings so all the build tools are in your
#      path.
#      E.g. source /opt/Xilinx/Vivado/2015.1/settings64.sh
#           source /opt/Xilinx/SDK/2015.1/settings64.sh
#
#	2. Run 'make' to build all the FPGA and software necessary to run the OPL3
#	   and create an SD card image.
#
#	3. Copy the resulting BOOT.bin to an SD card, insert it into the ZYBO.
#
#	4. Set JP5 to SD.
#
#	5. Connect the USB cable to PROG/UART, connect to PC.
#
#	6. Run a terminal program, use 115200 baud, 8-N-1.
#
#	7. Power on the ZYBO. In your terminal you should see:
#          Welcome to the OPL3 FPGA
#
#          Type 'help' for a list of commands
#          >
#
#	   Enjoy!
